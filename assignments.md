In preparation for the first discussion section, first install <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/">R</a>, and then
install <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>
(you'll get an error if you install RStudio first!).
[Section 1.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites) of R for Data Science has some tips for installation.
Feel free to post on [Ed](https://canvas.stanford.edu) with any installation problems, and be sure to follow the [Ed posting norms](../ed_tips).

Take a screenshot of RStudio installed on your machine with your full name written in the R console.
Submit via [Canvas](https://canvas.stanford.edu).
